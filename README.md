# 📝 Project Description

This project aims to perform customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation helps businesses understand distinct groups of customers, enabling targeted marketing and personalized experiences. The dataset contains customer attributes such as demographic information, purchasing behavior, and other relevant features. The goal is to group similar customers together to understand their characteristics and tailor strategies accordingly.

# 💡 Motivation

Customer segmentation is crucial for businesses looking to enhance customer satisfaction and optimize marketing efforts. By segmenting customers, companies can develop targeted strategies to increase retention and maximize revenue.

# 🛠️ Technologies and Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

# ⚙️ Data Preprocessing

- Data Cleaning: Handled missing values and removed redundant features.
- Encoding: Applied encoding techniques to transform categorical variables.
- Scaling: Used StandardScaler to normalize data.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Applied PCA to reduce the data dimensionality and retain variance.

# 🚀 Clustering and Modeling

- Used K-Means clustering to segment customers based on their attributes.
- Determined the optimal number of clusters using:
- Elbow Method (Inertia)
- Silhouette Method (Silhouette Score)
- Visualized clusters using PCA-transformed data.
- Analyzed cluster centroids to understand customer characteristics.

# 📊 Results and Visualizations

- The clusters were visualized using scatter plots with principal components. The analysis revealed distinct customer segments that could be interpreted for marketing and business strategy purposes.

#🚦 Usage and How to Run

- Clone the repository.
- Install the required libraries using:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the Jupyter Notebook:
- jupyter notebook Customer_Segmentation.ipynb

Follow the steps in the notebook to reproduce the clustering results.

# 🚀 Future Improvements

-Experiment with other clustering algorithms like DBSCAN or Agglomerative Clustering.
-Integrate real-time prediction for new customer data.
-Improve visualization with interactive plots (e.g., Plotly).
